# DeepLearningAssignments

Welcome to **DeepLearningAssignments**! This repository contains four deep learning assignments that cover advanced topics in neural networks, machine learning, and optimization techniques.

## Assignments:

### 1. **Deep Dive into RNNs and Gradient Issues** 
   - Explore the fundamental challenges of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients.
   - This assignment dives into the architecture of RNNs and demonstrates how these gradient problems can impact training and performance.

### 2. **LSTM Architecture and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**
   - Learn about Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a solution to the gradient issues in RNNs.
   - Understand the process of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and how it helps in training deep learning models on sequential data.

### 3. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Regularization in Advanced Machine Learning**
   - This assignment focuses on the art of hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques such as L1, L2 regularization, and Dropout.
   - Learn how to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

### 4. **Advanced Optimization Techniques for Deep Learning**
   - Explore advanced optimization methods like Adam, Adagrad, and RMSprop.
   - Learn how these techniques improve the training process for deep learning models, ensuring better convergence and faster training times.

## Folder Structure:

Each assignment is structured as a separate directory, with necessary scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and supporting files:

```
